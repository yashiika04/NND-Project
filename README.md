# 5G Network Slicing for Dynamic Traffic Optimization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **dynamic network slicing** in 5G networks, aiming to optimize **bandwidth allocation and resource management** for diverse traffic types: **eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC**. The project introduces a **MATLAB-based slicing approach** alongside a **CNN-based model** for adaptive resource allocation. It also integrates **real-time network traffic analysis** to improve slicing efficiency and responsiveness.

## Objectives
- Develop and evaluate a **MATLAB-based slicing method** to optimize bandwidth allocation.
- Implement a **priority-based slicing** mechanism for different 5G traffic types.
- Design and train a **CNN-based model** to predict optimal resource allocation dynamically.
- Integrate **real-time traffic data** using tools like Wireshark, Scapy, and Speedtest for practical validation.

## Methodology
### 1. **MATLAB-Based Network Slicing**
- Simulated dynamic traffic for **eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC**.
- Implemented an **interference-aware bandwidth allocation model**.
- Designed a **priority-based slicing** strategy for optimized performance.

### 2. **CNN-Based Network Slicing Optimization**
- Developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model** for predictive slicing.
- Trained the model on network traffic datasets to enhance decision-making.
- Evaluated CNN-based slicing against traditional methods for accuracy and efficiency.

### 3. **Real-Time Network Data Integration**
- Collected live network packets using **Wireshark/tshark**.
- Allocated slices dynamically based on real-time traffic flow and packet characteristics.
- Evaluated slicing efficiency in response to varying network conditions.

## Future Work
- Expanding real-time data collection with larger datasets.
- Enhancing CNN models for increased adaptability and accuracy.
- Deploying and testing the slicing framework on real-world **5G testbeds**.
