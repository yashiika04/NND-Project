# Efficient Slicing Strategies for Scalable 5G Networks
The evolution of 5G networks has introduced diverse service requirements, ranging from high-speed broadband to ultra-reliable low-latency communication and massive machine-type communication. Addressing these heterogeneous demands necessitates the concept of Network Slicing, where the physical infrastructure is partitioned into multiple logical networks (slices), each optimized for specific use cases.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on proposing two effective methods for optimizing 5G network slicing:
1.	Priority-Based Network Slicing with Interference Awareness
2.	Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Based Network Slicing Optimization

In the first method, we incorporate interference factors to simulate real-world scenarios and introduce a priority-based mechanism to ensure better resource allocation aligned with service requirements. The second method leverages the power of deep learning to predict optimal resource allocation dynamically.
